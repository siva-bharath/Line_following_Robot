# Line_following_Robot

In this project , a line following mobile robot was designed to navigate along a specific path. The path of robot contains series of sharp curves and turns designed to test the agility of the controller. Finally , the mobile robot has to return its original location where it was started. This kind of scenarios were applicable to track an underground subsea cable of unknown length and return to its destination.

A line sensor was attached to the mobile robot to check the presence of line.
